<br>

<h1 align="center">DISCLAIMER</h1>

<p align="center">Jailbreaking your iOS device involves bypassing Apple's built-in restrictions, which can grant additional features and customization options. However, this process carries several risks: it voids any existing warranty or support agreements with Apple, making you ineligible for service or repairs; it exposes your device to potential security vulnerabilities, including malware and data breaches; it may lead to system instability, causing crashes or performance issues; and future iOS updates might not be compatible with your jailbroken device, complicating the process of updating or restoring it. Additionally, while jailbreaking is legal in some regions, it may be restricted or illegal in others, so it's crucial to understand the legal implications in your area. <b>I am not responsible for any damage, data loss, security issues, or legal consequences that may arise from jailbreaking your device. By proceeding with a jailbreak, you acknowledge and accept all associated risks and responsibilities.</b></p>

# Supported Enviroments
Pip3rm0n is supported on every OSes that has a web browser, not recommended using Internet Explorer tho, the website will surely break.

# Usage
Click on `Initialize` right from the homepage, it will detect the nearest iOS device that's connected to the same WiFi as your PC then jailbreak it.

# How it works
Pip3rm0n uses **a WiFi based kernel exploit** made by my friend, the exploit currently has no name but I like to call it Wipl0it.
Files will be downloaded server-side when you click on `Initialize`.

I have nothing left to say how it works, it's complicated, it's a huge project.

# Credits
Huge thanks to r/JelBrek for inspiring me to make this project!
